# lol-language-selector
A utility made in Python to change League of Legends locale.

It's necessary to add the line "-locale='language_code'" to the shortcut address created by the program for it to work. 
I'm too lazy and haven't done it yet, but it should be trivial.

You can find a list of the language codes in https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol
